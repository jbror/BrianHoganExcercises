#The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
#So create a program that prompts for your name and printsa greeting using your name.

#Example Output
#What is your name? Brian
#Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!

#Constraints
#Different people deserve different greetings.

#The default greeting is, as presented above, "Hello, [name], nice to meet you!"
#But there are certain exceptions:

#Here is a list names that should have certain greetings
#"Glenn" -> "Hallåå eller änna Glenn"
#"Alfred", "Erik" -> "Tjena brorsan"

#And as in the previous excercise, try to structure your program into meaningful functions and be mindful in how you name them.
